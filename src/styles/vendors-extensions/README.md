# Vendors Extensions

If you have to override a section of any vendor, you may create files here named exactly 
after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, `vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` 
is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS. 
This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
